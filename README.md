# Big-Things
Looks teasing, but this is a real application for "Big Things"
 
Said earlier, this assignment has not been graded by the lecturer, but I think it is a highly completed assignment
 
This application can load and modify Big things stored in online database via API.

Use swift's core data on local storage, added a like button to mark the big things you like.
 
At the same time, a map module has been added to provide true navigation. If you are really interested in this big thing and want to see it with your own eyes
 
It can be said that it fully meets the requirements of the assignment, and I deserve an excellent evaluation.
